# react-video-chat-app

I did this project because I wanted to build a video chat application. I've always thought that type of technology was cool and I wanted to see what it took to make it work.

# Environment Setup

1. Clone my repo at https://github.com/davidmstanleyjr/react-video-chat-app

2. CD into it and run npm install to install all of the dependencies.

# Technologies Used

1. React JS
2. JavaScript
3. Material UI
4. Netlify
5. Heroku.
6. Express
7. Simple Peer
8. Socket IO
9. React Copy to clipboard

# Issues

This project was incredibly difficult. I used socket io to handle the calls but it wouldn't work. I had to write logic to refresh the page after ending each call because the page would get stuck. I also used react copy to clipboard to create random ID's for each caller. That was tough but I figured it out. Then I realized I had to deploy the front end and back end separately because they use different servers. It took me a while to figure all this out but I did it.
